Exercises by hand :

1)  Consider the following ifâ€¦then logic:
                 if(age > 65) socialSecurityStatus = "eligible";
                  else socialSecurityStatus = "ineligible";

                 Rewrite this (pseudo) code using the Java ternary operator. 

Solution:

socialSecurityStaus = (age>65) ? "eligible" : "ineligible"

2)  Suppose a String s is initialized by
       String s = "a friendly face";

                a. Compute the value of the expression
         s.charAt(2);
                b. What is the value of
         s.length()?
                c. What is the value of
         s.substring(2,9)?
         s.substring(4)?

Solution:

a. f
b. 15
c. friendl
d. iendly face

3) Write a Java expression that computes each of the following:
               a. Given the radius r of a circle, compute the area of the circle, and store it in a
                   variable A.
               b. Given the length len and width wid of a rectangle, compute the length of the
                   diagonal of the rectangle, and store it in a variable diag.

Solution:

a. double A = (Math.PI*Math.pow(r, 2));

b. double leng = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(len, 2) + Math.pow(wid, 2))


4) You are reviewing some old Java programs in your company's IT department and you
               read the following assignment statement in some abandoned code:
       int a = (b = 5);
               Is the statement legal (i.e. would it compile)? If so, what value is assigned to the
               variable a? Explain.

Solutuion:

Yes, It is legal (i.e. it will compile) under one condition that variable b should be initialized (i.e. int b) then
variable a will be assigned as 5.
